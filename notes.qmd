# The Science of Learning

1.  Describe how learning works in terms of cognitive attention, working
    memory, prior knowledge, and retrieval;
2.  Identify key levers for student self-regulation of learning, through the
    prompting of metacognitive processes and motivation to learn;
3.  Explain, by way of well-defined key concepts and terms, the value of
    adopting a learner-centered teaching mindset.

## How Learning Works

1.  Describe the basics of how learning works, using key terms like
    *attention*, *working memory*, *prior knowledge*, and *retrieval*;
2.  Identify points in the learning process where you, as a TA or instructor,
    are able to impact whether and how much learning occurs.

-   The landscape of learning
    -   After we complete a learning activity, e.g., listening to lectures or
        doing homework.the brain does some stuff, and then we learn something.
    -   Metacognitive awareness is an individual's awareness of their learning
        and of the things that impact their learning. Knowing what you do or
        don't understand and when you need to take a break or review something
        again.
    -   Motivation to learn is a major contributor to learning. Combined with
        metacognitive awareness, this leads to self-regulating behaviors.
    -   Self-regulating behaviors: things like goal-setting and decision
        making, which can have a positive impact on the degree of learning.
    -   High levels of stress or distraction, along with other barriers, can
        negatively impact learning.
    -   The context of learning almost always involves a sociocultural aspect
        of interacting with other learners. Interactions with other learners
        can be both positive and negative.
    -   Most of learning is *not* about baseline intelligence, but rather
        about how these different factors interact.
-   Cognitive process for learning
    -   Learning begins when we sense something, and take it into our
        **sensory memory**. The sensory memory has a large capacity to process
        a lot of information at the same time. However, the duration of the
        sensory memory is very short. So we need to focus our senses on the
        right sensory information for long enough (**attention**) for sensory
        memories to be moved into the working memory.
    -   The **working memory** is where thinking happens and information is
        processed. We begin to understand things in the working memory. The
        working memory has a relatively small capacity, which means we can't
        work with that much new information at one time. It is important to
        avoid overloading the working memory.
    -   The **long-term memory** is accessed during learning (**retrieval**),
        including concepts, facts, and connections between ideas. We work with
        our sensory information and retrieve long-term memories at the same
        time, so it is important to ensure that learners can connect these
        two.
    -   We say that learning occurs when the results of working memory
        processing are **encoded** into our long-term memory, and we can
        retrieve them later.
    -   We take information into our senses, play around with it in the
        working memory, and hopefully encode it in the long-term memory. This
        is the part of the learning landscape where the "brain does some
        stuff".
-   Memory encoding
    -   **Encoding** refers to the process where short-term working
        information is converted into long-term storage in the brain. Once
        information is encoded, it can be recalled from either the short or
        long-term memory.
    -   The process of encoding begins with perceiving sensory information.
        Stimuli from the environment are perceived by sense organs, and
        information is transferred to the
        [thalamus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalamus), where they are
        synthesized. The
        [hippocampus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus) then analyses
        the experience and decides if it should be committed to long-term
        memory.
    -   Encoding is achieved when neural pathways are formed or strengthened
        through the process of **long-term potentiation**, which alters the
        flow of information within the brain. As a person consolidates their
        sensory and long-term information together in the working memory, the
        brain "rewires" itself to store new experiences in memory.
    -   Encoding can be optimized through organization of information. If
        information is improperly coded, recall will be more challenging later
        on. Several mechanisms can be used to improve encoding, but three
        common ones are: *mnemonics*, an organization technique that can be
        used to aid in memory; *chunking*, organizing parts of learning into
        meaningful wholes; or *state-dependent learning*, when a person
        remembers information based on the state of mind they are in when they
        learn in. Smells, sounds, and place of learning are all part of
        state-dependent learning.
    -   **Memory consolidation** is a category of processes that stabilize a
        memory after initial encoding, and influences the ease of recall.
        While encoding is influenced by attention and conscious effort,
        processes involved in consolidation occur at the cellular level and
        are unconscious. Consolidation happens when we sleep.
    -   Providing clear and well-organized information is the easiest way for
        instructors to help students with memory encoding. For example,
        providing a course outline with delineated chunks can encourage
        learning. Explicitly making connections with other material the
        students already know is also beneficial.
-   The Role of attention in memory
    -   *attentional capture* is the process of paying attention to a
        particular piece of information. Attentional capture is the necessary
        first step for information to be encoded into a long term memory.
    -   **Explicit attentional capture** is when a stimulus that a person has
        not been paying attention to becomes salient enough that an individual
        begins to pay attention to it and becomes cognizant of its existence.
        Simply, it's when something catches your attention and you actively
        choose to focus on it. For example, if you are doing your homework and
        someone calls your name, your attention is redirected to the person
        calling your name.
    -   **Implicit attentional capture** is when a stimulus that a person is
        not attending to has an impact on their behavior, regardless of
        whether they are cognizant of the stimulus. For example, if you do
        your homework while quiet but annoying music is playing in the
        background, the music can disrupt your ability to focus on the
        homework even if you don't choose to pay attention to it.
    -   The working memory has limited capacity and has to take in thousands
        of pieces of information every second. Based on past experiences,
        current thoughts, or long-term recall information, the working memory
        decides if any particular piece of information is important or
        relevant.
    -   Attentional capture encodes a stimulus into working memory, at which
        point the memory is manipulated to associate it with other concepts
        and stimuli. The memory will then be encoded into long-term memory or
        forgotten.
    -   Instructional words or cues to direct attentional capture can play an
        important role in teaching and allow learners to focus on the
        important concepts to encode into long-term memory.
    -   Explicitly mentioning transitions and connections can improve
        attentional capture and encoding into long-term memory.
    -   Recognizing the smaller capacity of the working memory is very
        important for teaching â€“ if we overload students with facts, they will
        prevent the earlier facts before encoding them into memory.
-   Memory storage and retrieval
    -   Memories are not stored as exact replicas but are instead modified and
        reconstructed during retrieval and recall.
    -   Memory storage is achieved through the process of encoding, through
        either short or long-term memory.
    -   Information in short-term memory deteriorates constantly; however, if
        the information is deemed important or useful, it is transferred to
        LTM for extended storage. These long-term memories must be
        consolidated to optimize storage.
    -   LTMs still decay over time, and as the retention interval between
        encoding and retrieval of the memory lengthens, the accuracy of the
        memory decreases.
    -   The two main types of memory retrieval are **recall**, retrieving
        information from long-term memories; and **recognition**, where an
        outside stimulus provides a clue that the information has been seen
        before.
    -   Recall can be assisted when the retrieval cues are presented that
        enable the subject to quickly access the information in memory, which
        is why it is valuable to provide students with instructional cues to
        help activate their prior knowledge.
    -   By providing cues and regularly asking students to retrieve the same
        memories, we can improve encoding into long-term memory and
        additionally increase the ability of learners to recall the same
        information. This practice increases the likelihood of recall of the
        right things at the right time.
